# FLIR Converter

## Overview
Convert FLIR raw data into geotiff raster data product of observed temperature.


_Input_

  - FLIR raw data in .bin file
  - reference metadata in .json file
    
_Output_

  - A heat map with a scale of min-max value in the input .bin file, save as a png file
  - A TIFF file consist of geospatial attributes and temperature in Kelvin Degree in each pixel

## Algorithm Description

### Algorithm

Our codes is a re-implementation of this matlab code ([https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/blob/master/scripts/FLIR/FlirRawToTemperature.m](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/blob/master/scripts/FLIR/FlirRawToTemperature.m)) converted into python.

1. Atmospheric transmission - correction factor from air temperature, relative humidity and distance of sensor to object.

2. Correct raw pixel values from external factors,

    1. General equation : Total Radiation = Object Radiation + Atmosphere Radiation + Ambient Reflection Radiation

    2. Object Radiation = Theoretical object radiation * emissivity * atmospheric transmission

    3. Atmosphere Radiation= (1 - atmospheric transmission) * Theoretical atmospheric radiation

    4. Ambient Reflection Radiation = (1 - emissivity) * atmospheric transmission * Theoretical Ambient Reflection Radiation

3. RBF equation: transformation of pixel intensity in radiometric temperature from raw values or corrected values

4.  Algorithm parameters:

       R: Planck constant		function of integration time and wavelength)

       B: Planck constant		function of wavelength

       F: Planck constant		positive value (0 - 1)

       J0: global offset

       J1: global gain

       X, a1, b1, a2, b2: Constant Atmospheric transmission parameter by Flir

       H2O_K1, H2O_K2, H2O_K3, H2O_K4: Constant for VPD computation (sqtrH2O)



   Environmental factors:

       H = Relative Humidity from the gantry (0 - 1)

       T = air temperature in degree Celsius from the gantry

       D = Object Distance - camera/canopy (m)

       E = object emissivity, vegetation is around 0.98, bare soil around 0.93â€¦

### Parameters

    HEIGHT_MAGIC_NUMBER: To obtain a well stitched map, a HEIGHT_MAGIC_NUMBER was applied when we estimate the field of view, this is a testing based number.

    The geo-reference bounding box based on an assumption of image axis is in a same direction of lat-lon axis.


### Failure Conditions

1. Because of a failure of weatherproof system, data from 05-01-2017 to 10-01-2017 can not be used

2. If the sensor is moved within the sensor box, the HEIGHT_MAGIC_NUMBER might need to change in order to correctly stitch the images.

## Implementation

### Docker
The Dockerfile included in this directory can be used to launch this extractor in a container.

_Building the Docker image_
```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t terra-ext-flir2tif .
```

_Running the image locally_
```
docker run \
  -p 5672 -p 9000 --add-host="localhost:{LOCAL_IP}" \
  -v /local/raw_data/folder:/home/extractor/sites/ua-mac/raw_data \
  -v /local/output/root/folder:/home/extractor/sites/ua-mac/Level_1/flir2tif \
  -e RABBITMQ_URI=amqp://{RMQ_USER}:{RMQ_PASSWORD}@localhost:5672/%2f \
  -e RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE=clowder \
  -e REGISTRATION_ENDPOINTS=http://localhost:9000/clowder/api/extractors?key={SECRET_KEY} \
  -e INFLUXDB_PASSWORD={INFLUX_PASS} \
  terra-ext-flir2tif
```
Note that by default RabbitMQ will not allow "guest:guest" access to non-local addresses, which includes Docker. You may need to create an additional local RabbitMQ user for testing.

_Running the image remotely_
```
docker run \
  -v /sites/ua-mac/raw_data:/home/extractor/sites/ua-mac/raw_data \
  -v /sites/ua-mac/Level_1/flir2tif:/home/extractor/sites/ua-mac/Level_1/flir2tif \
  -e RABBITMQ_URI=amqp://{RMQ_USER}:{RMQ_PASSWORD}@rabbitmq.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder \
  -e RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE=terra \
  -e REGISTRATION_ENDPOINTS=http://terraref.ncsa.illinosi.edu/clowder//api/extractors?key={SECRET_KEY} \
  -e INFLUXDB_PASSWORD={INFLUX_PASS} \
  terra-ext-flir2tif
```

### Dependencies

* All the Python scripts syntactically support Python 2.7 and above. Please make sure that the Python in the running environment is in appropriate version.

* All the Python scripts also rely on the third-party library including: PIL, scipy, numpy, matplotlib and osgeo.

### Notice

* flir_test.sh is an example of using this python script. using '-i' to indicates the input directory that contains of one day's flir data, using '-o' to indicates the output directory
