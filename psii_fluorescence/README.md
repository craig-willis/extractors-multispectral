### Description

This script computes all characterisitc fluorescence features for dark and light-adapted plants

PSII.m computes a range of biologically relevant features from recorded PS2 images as gray scale images. 
Features are desccribed below based on [Maxwell and Johnson (2000)](https://github.com/terraref/extractors-multispectral/blob/master/psii_fluorescence/ChlorophyllFluorescence-PracticalGuide.pdf).

### Limitations

Note that the parameter F0_light cannot be measured in the light, since we have a mixture of chlorophyll fluorescence and light. Hence the parameters Phi_PSII, qN, qP cannot be interpreted biologically relevant.

To measure F0_light one would need a light source (during the night) with emission < 690 nm with a duration of 3-5 min before taking the F0_image. A similar protocol is used by the CropReporter Fluorescence System of Phenovation B.V.
